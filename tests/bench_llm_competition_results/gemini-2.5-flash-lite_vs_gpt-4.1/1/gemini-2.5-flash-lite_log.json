The error message suggests a valid coordinate like (16, 20). The enemy carrier is expected to be around (26, 26). My carrier AC1 is at (3, 1). The operational range of the squadrons is 22. (26, 26) is too far. I need to choose a launch target that is within 22 hexes of my carrier and still moves me closer to the enemy's suspected area. (16, 20) is a valid target, but it might be too far south and not optimal for scouting the (26, 26) area directly. I should select a target that is within range and directs the squadrons towards the general direction of the enemy. Let's try a coordinate that is closer to the enemy's expected location but still within range. A coordinate like (19, 19) would be within range (distance from (3,1) to (19,19) is sqrt((19-3)^2 + (19-1)^2) = sqrt(16^2 + 18^2) = sqrt(256 + 324) = sqrt(580) approx 24. This is still slightly out of range. Let's try (18, 18). Distance is sqrt((18-3)^2 + (18-1)^2) = sqrt(15^2 + 17^2) = sqrt(225 + 289) = sqrt(514) approx 22.6. Still a bit out. Let's calculate the max range precisely. Max distance is 22. From (3,1), a target (x,y) must satisfy (x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 <= 22^2 = 484. Let's try launching towards the general direction of the enemy, a point within range. A point like (18, 18) is sqrt(15^2 + 17^2) approx 22.6, which is slightly too far. How about (17, 17)? (17-3)^2 + (17-1)^2 = 14^2 + 16^2 = 196 + 256 = 452. This is within range (sqrt(452) approx 21.26). So, (17, 17) is a valid launch target that moves the squadrons towards the enemy's suspected area.
