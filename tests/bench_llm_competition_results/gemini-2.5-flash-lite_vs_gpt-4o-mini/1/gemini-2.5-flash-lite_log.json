The previous error message correctly stated that I cannot launch new squadrons as both are already deployed. My intention was to redirect the already deployed squadrons ASQ1 and ASQ2 to attack the enemy squadron BSQ1 at (15, 15). Since I cannot issue a `launch_target` order, I need to find a way to redirect the existing squadrons. The problem description does not explicitly state that I can redirect deployed squadrons via `launch_target`. However, the prompt implies that I should fix the order, and the previous attempt at `launch_target` for redirection failed. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The `launch_target` is used to \"launch\" squadrons. It is not explicitly mentioned that it can be used to redirect deployed squadrons. However, given the context of fixing the order and the goal of engaging the enemy, the most logical interpretation is that `launch_target` *should* be used for redirection if no new squadrons are available. The error message might be overly strict, or I am misunderstanding its application.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that `launch_target` *is* the intended way to redirect, and the error implies that the target coordinates themselves might be the issue *in conjunction with* the status of the squadrons. But the error specifically says \"all air squadrons are deployed on missions, and there are no squadrons aboard the carrier. Orders cannot be issued to squadrons that are already deployed.\" This strongly suggests I cannot order *new* launches or *redirect* deployed squadrons using `launch_target`.\n\nTherefore, I cannot issue any new orders to launch or redirect squadrons at this moment. My current plan is for ASQ1 and ASQ2 to continue towards their original targets (18, 18 and 17, 19 respectively). However, ASQ1 did spot BSQ1 at (15, 15). Given ASQ1's current position (11, 13) and destination (18, 18), and BSQ1's position (15, 15), ASQ1 is already moving towards an area very close to BSQ1. If ASQ1 reaches (15, 15) on its current trajectory, it will be in a position to attack BSQ1.\n\nSince I cannot actively redirect, I will let ASQ1 and ASQ2 continue their current paths. ASQ1 is closer to the spotted enemy squadron. I will monitor their progress and hope they engage the enemy squadron. My carrier should remain stationary to avoid detection.\n\nCorrection: The example in the prompt's rules states: \"航空部隊はlaunch_targetに目標座標を指定してorderすると発艦して目標座標へ向かう。行動中は帰投まで目標変更できない。\" (Squadrons launch and head to the target coordinates when ordered with a launch_target. They cannot change their target until they return home.) This rule explicitly states that deployed squadrons CANNOT change their target. Therefore, my previous attempts to redirect using `launch_target` were fundamentally flawed. I cannot issue any orders to ASQ1 or ASQ2. My only option is to let them continue their current paths. My carrier should remain stationary.\n\nTherefore, no action can be taken for the squadrons. I will not move the carrier either, as it's best to remain hidden. The original thought process was to redirect, but the rules prevent it. Thus, no order for carrier_target or launch_target.\", \"action\": {\"carrier_target\": null, \"launch_target\": null}}"

However, ASQ2's current order is to go to (13, 15), and deployed squadrons cannot change their target. Since ASQ1 is returning, I cannot launch it again effectively with only 2 turns left. Moving the carrier is also unlikely to help find the enemy carrier in time. I will let ASQ2 continue its course and hope it spots something, or engages BSQ1 if their paths cross.
