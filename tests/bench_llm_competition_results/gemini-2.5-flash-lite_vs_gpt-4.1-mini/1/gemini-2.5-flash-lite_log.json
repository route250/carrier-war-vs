This confirms the presence of two enemy squadrons in the southeast region. My original plan was for ASQ1 to head towards (20, 16) and ASQ2 towards (21, 17). Both squadrons are now converging on the area where the enemy squadrons were last seen. I should direct ASQ1 to attack BSQ1, as it's closer to ASQ1's current path. ASQ2 should also be directed to attack BSQ1 as it is also heading towards that area. The carrier AC1 should remain stationary to avoid detection and conserve its position. I need to check the launch range for ASQ2 to attack BSQ1. ASQ2 is at (14, 13) and BSQ1 is at (15, 11). The distance is sqrt((15-14)^2 + (11-13)^2) = sqrt(1^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(1+4) = sqrt(5) which is well within the operational range. The same applies for ASQ1. The problem states that squadrons attack carriers, and squadrons do not attack each other. So, I cannot order an attack on the enemy squadrons. I need to re-evaluate the objective. The objective is to sink the enemy carrier or destroy all enemy squadrons. I have detected two enemy squadrons. My squadrons are not meant to attack other squadrons. I need to use my squadrons to find the enemy carrier. The current positions of the enemy squadrons might be a distraction or a defensive screen for the enemy carrier. Since my squadrons cannot attack each other, my best course of action is to continue reconnaissance. I will have ASQ1 continue towards (20, 16) to see if it can spot the enemy carrier.

My carrier AC1 is stationary at (18, 16) and has spotted BC1 at (21, 17) and BSQ1 at (20, 17). The enemy carrier BC1 is at (22, 18) with 15 HP. BSQ1 is at (20, 17). ASQ1 is the primary attacking force. ASQ2 is also heading towards the enemy carrier's general area. I will keep AC1 stationary at (18, 16) to provide a stable base and potential support. I will let ASQ1 and ASQ2 continue their approach. It's crucial to finish off the enemy carrier with ASQ1.\", \"action\": {\"carrier_target\": null, \"launch_target\": null}}"
